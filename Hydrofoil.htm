<font size="2" face="Arial">Developed for use on a speed sailing record
challenger, these
inverted tee foils feature a complex foil design, incorporating sweep, taper,
and a variable thickness distribution to optimize speed, drag, and structural
considerations. Extremely high lift to drag ratios are achieved from the 13:1
aspect ratio of the lifting foil, and by the use of NACA low drag sections
duplicated with high fidelity by the CNC mold making and net female metal
molding techniques employed in its fabrication.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The hydrofoils were fabricated from high strength
carbon fiber pre-preg laid continuously from tip to tip and from tip to end so
that there are no fibers terminated in the high stress area of the tee where the
lifting foil joins the vertical foil. Molded surfaces are hydrodynamically
smooth right from the mold.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">These foils were designed and fabricated
completely in house, as were the matched aluminum molds.</font></p>
