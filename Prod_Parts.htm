<p><font face="Arial" size="2">High degree of difficulty aircraft parts like this door hinge component,
control linkage pivot, and wing flap control clevis (all for various Boeing
commercial aircraft) represent some of the parts that Kinetic Research has
produced successfully. These parts typically come in lots of 30 to 150 pieces,
and are characterized by tight tolerances, rigid inspection requirements, and
difficult to machine features (deep slots, compound angles, etc.). The door
hinge component on the left required 7 different fixturing positions to machine!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">These parts are from a wood floor installation tool. Kinetic Research did the
complete detail design and production process for this tool. The plate on the
left was cut eight at a time from 3/16 aluminum plate on a vacuum fixture we
produced in-house. The finished tool consisted of about 12 various machined
parts, knobs, and fasteners, and was delivered to the customer assembled,
lubricated, and ready for use. We produced several hundred of these units during
the production contract.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kinetic Research specializes in parts and
accessories for large ship propellers. The gland ring on the left is 36 inches
in diameter, machined on our custom large CNC rotary table which installs onto
our Fadal VMC. We produce gland rings for 688 and Trident class submarines, as
well as other U.S. Naval surface ships. The side hole plugs on the right, used
on 688 class submarines, are machined from naval bronze bar stock. They have
heads that are 5 inches in diameter; the threaded portion is a 4 inch diameter 8
pitch thread that we thread mill using helical interpolation on our Fadal VMC.</font></p>
