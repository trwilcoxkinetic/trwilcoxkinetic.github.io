<p><font size="2">Born and raised in Monterey Park, California (a suburb of Los
Angeles), Tom received his Bachelor of Science degree from Cal Poly, Pomona. In
college, Tom was a diehard member of the Society of Automotive Engineers,
serving as President of the college chapter, and he and the chapter designed and
built the regional championship winning Mini Baja Design Competition entry from
Cal Poly for two years running. Interestingly enough, this design competition is
still active today. After school, Tom
served a two year stint at Garret AiResearch, where he worked in the motor
driven fans and compressors group as a development engineer. Tom formed his own
company &quot;Motive Systems&quot; with a business partner, Randy Coons, in 1981. The
pair gained notoriety in racing circles by developing what became the premier
road racing go-kart chassis in the US, the Motive Systems Van-K &quot;New
Wave&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">After leaving Motive, Tom worked for Lips Propellers, a major player in the field of large ship propeller manufacture and
repair. Tom became the chief engineer and one of the founding personnel of the
Lips Seattle facility, and worked for several years developing and perfecting
repair methods and procedures, equipment, and facilities for the Seattle shop,
which specialized in repair, refit, and recertification of mission critical U.S.
Navy submarine and surface vessel propellers. (Note: Lips was acquired by
Wartsila several years ago, and now maintains the same business as Wartsila
Defence, Inc. Kinetic Research continues to support their facilities in Poulsbo,
WA and Chesapeake, VA.)</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Tom joined Boone Metalworks, Inc. in 1991. The original
business was in Oakland, and later, after changing its name to Kinetic Research,
Inc., relocated to Cordelia, California. The company moved to its present
location in Kingston, Washington in 1994, and has been busily designing,
machining, and assembling a wide variety of projects ever since.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Tom is an avid amateur musician, playing in local bands
and recording original music in his PC based home studio.</font> <font size="2">Other
hobbies include a house, a wife, and a son.</font></p>
