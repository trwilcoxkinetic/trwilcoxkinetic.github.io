<p><font size="2">Steve was born in Oakland and grew up in Lafayette,
California.&nbsp; He received a Bachelor of Arts Degree from St. John's College
in 1978.&nbsp; That was reinforced by a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical
Engineering from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in 1982.&nbsp; Steve worked as a
machinist at Safety Line Corp. and received training in NC machining during the
summer of 1980.&nbsp; After graduating from Cal Poly Steve worked for Morrow
Designs, a small personal computer manufacturer which staked its very existence
on the CPM operating system.&nbsp; After the arrival of DOS, Steve went to work
for Bausch and Lomb Ophthalmic Instruments Division.&nbsp; After two years as
Manufacturing Engineer for Bausch and Lomb Steve decided to start his own
company.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">In 1987, Boone Metalworks, Inc. was established in Oakland,
California.&nbsp; In 1991, after taking on Tom Wilcox as a partner and
relocating to Cordelia, California, Boone Metalworks, Inc. changed its name to
Kinetic Research, Inc.&nbsp; Inspired by a dislike of long commutes and, in
anticipation of severe power shortages in California, Kinetic Research, Inc.
relocated to the bucolic setting of Kingston, Washington in fall of 1994.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Steve retired to warmer climes in 2016, where he is closely 
supervised by his wife, two adult children, and two grandchildren.</font></p>
